   /// Processor, that executes different localization algorithms
   /** There are anchorbased and anchorless algorithms. Anchorbased means, that
    *  unknown nodes, which do not know their position, need some nodes in the
    *  topology, which know their position. Anchorless algorithms build a
    *  relative coordinate system without the need of position aware nodes.
    *  Generally you should not mix these algorithms because potentially
    *  there will be no result.
    *
    *  Localization is cut in three phases depending on using anchors or not.
    *
    *  Anchorbased: At first, unknown nodes try to
    *  estimate their distance to the anchors. Second, with the resulting
    *  information the position is calculated. Third, an optional one, the
    *  estimated position is calibrated, e.g. with help of neighbors
    *  information.
    *
    *  Anchorless: At first, nodes try to get information about their
    *  neighborhood and build a local coordinate system. Second, they will
    *  build a global, or rather network, coordinate system. Third phase
    *  is an optional one where the positions and coordinate systems are
    *  calibrated.
    *
    *  The algorithms are not designed for mobility primary, but there is a
    *  chance to do so. In general each phase is processed one time before
    *  the processor deactivate itself. Therefor you could give an rollback
    *  number, which rerun the phases after the given number of rounds.
    *  Moreover there is an rollback_limit which limit the number of
    *  maximal rollbacks.
    *
    *  The algorithms are implemented in so called
    *  \ref LocalizationModule "modules", one designed for each algorithm in
    *  each phase. All algorithms and calculations work on the same
    *  \ref LocalizationNeighborhood "neighborhood".
    *  <hr>
    *
    *  <b>Using this processor with parameters</b>
    *
    *  TODO: Write this; do same in each module, too.
    *  <hr>
    *
    *  <b>Writing your own modules</b>
    *
    *  To write an own module, you have to create a new class derived from
    *  LocalizationModule in the appropriate directory,
    *  namely <em>module/distance</em>, <em>module/position</em> or
    *  <em>module/refinement</em> and put all the wanted intelligence in it.
    *  If there are messages to be sent, there is an corresponding directory
    *  order in <em>messages/</em>.
    *
    *  To include this module in this \ref LocalizationProcessor "Processor",
    *  you should give a name in DIST_ALGOS[], POS_ALGOS[] or REF_ALGOS[]
    *  used by commandline or configuration file. Moreover there are
    *  enumerations in the private part of this class, namely DistanceAlgorithm,
    *  PositionAlgorithm and RefinementAlgorithm. You should give a name here,
    *  too, which has to be in the order as in the above mentioned arrays.
    *
    *  After you have done this, the module has to be inserted in the method
    *  LocalizationProcessor::init_modules just like the existing ones.
    *  <hr>
    *
    *  <b>Comment by the author</b>
    *
    *  This implementation was originally designed just for anchorbased
    *  algorithms devided in mentioned three phases. Done this, the
    *  anchorless algorithm(s) followed. Perhaps it would be an
    *  advantage to avoid this static phase-behavior and use the shawn-like
    *  factory structure to use more or less modules per processor
    *  (or will it be done later?).
    *
    *  Moreover, with increasing the number of modules, the
    *  \ref LocalizationNeighborhood "neighborhood" became more and more
    *  complicated. It would be appreciated to change this structure, because
    *  easy and fast algorithms like DV-hop and Min-Max have to carry a very
    *  big and useless overhead.
