   /// Basic neighborhood operations
   /** This class combines \ref LocalizationNeighborInfo "neighbors" to a
    *  neighborhood. In addition to basic methods such like adding an anchor
    *  or neighbor, there are operations on the neighborhood like counting
    *  anchors or something alike.
    *
    *  At first, there are the above mentioned basic methods like
    *  adding/updating anchors or neighbors, methods for searching certain
    *  anchors/neighbors in the neighborhood, same with distances, and simply
    *  methods which return iterators.\n
    *  To add more information to a neighbor, you have to direct access the
    *  LocalizationNeighborInfo via find_w() and resulting iterator.
    *
    *  Second there is a chance to decide, whether the neighborhood is sound
    *  or not. This means, that the received information is unique. The
    *  neighborhood is sound, if there are at least three/four valid anchors,
    *  for which the data is received by different neighbors. Moreover, e.g.
    *  the LocalizationIterLaterationModule does this, you can add so called
    *  sound neighbors, so that the intersection of unique anchors and sound
    *  nodes has to be greater or equal than three/four.\n
    *  The sound nodes are stored in separate set
    *
    *  At last there are operations on the neighborhood. On the one hand
    *  the varying like reassign_twins(), on the other hand just \em const
    *  ones like valid_anchor_cnt() or confident_neighbor_cnt().
