   /// Module implementing refinement by iterative lateration
   /** This module implements refinement by iterative lateration. Idea is to
    *  take into account all neighbors, respectively their distances and
    *  positions, and start lateration with this information. After that the
    *  new position is broadcasted, so that neighbors are able to start
    *  lateration again with this new data, and so on.
    *
    *  The process finished, either after a given number of steps, or, if the
    *  position update becomes very small.
    *
    *  Main problem of this procedere are nodes with inaccurate information.
    *  To filter out most of these cases, there are different methods.
    *
    *  At first, there is the use of confidences. This means, that every node
    *  is associated with a special confidence level between 0 and 1. Unknowns
    *  start with a low confidence like 0.1, anchors with a high one like 1.
    *  These values are used in the
    *  \ref localization::est_pos_lateration "lateration" by a weighted least
    *  squares approach. Instead of solving \f$ Ax = b\f$,
    *  \f$ \omega Ax = \omega b\f$ is solved, where \f$\omega\f$ is the vector
    *  of confidences. After a successful lateration a node sets its
    *  confidence to the average of its neighbors confidences. This will, in
    *  general, increase the confidence level.
    *
    *  Second issue is filtering out ill-connected nodes.\n
    *  To take part in refinement phase, a node has to be \em sound. This
    *  means, that there are \em independent references to at least three/four
    *  anchors. That is, information about anchors has to be get from
    *  different neighbors. Moreover, if a node becomes sound, it sends this
    *  out. The neighbors again receiving this information, add the sound node
    *  to an own list, so that an unsound node is able to become sound, if
    *  the size of intersection between sound and references becomes greater
    *  or equal three/four.
    *
    *  Third, the twin neighbors should be filtered out. This means, that one
    *  neighbor, that is very close to another, is set to be a twin and is
    *  ignored in further computation. The twin check has to be done in every
    *  iteration, because in most cases their position change.
    *
    *  At least, there is the
    *  \ref localization::check_residue "residuen check" to check the validity
    *  of the new position. To avoid being trapped in a local minimum, there
    *  is a given chance to accept a failed check anyway. If this happens, the
    *  confidence of affected node is reduced by 50 percent.
