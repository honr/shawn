<h2>Name</h2>
<pre>  ctest - Testing driver provided by CMake.</pre>
    
<h2>Usage</h2>
<pre>  ctest [options]</pre>
    
<p>The "ctest" executable is the CMake test driver program.  CMake-generated build trees created for projects that use the ENABLE_TESTING and ADD_TEST commands have testing support.  This program will run the tests and report results.
<h2>Command-Line Options</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b><code>-C &lt;cfg&gt;, --build-config &lt;cfg&gt;</code></b>: Choose configuration to test.<br>
    <p>Some CMake-generated build trees can have multiple build configurations in the same tree.  This option can be used to specify which one should be tested.  Example configurations are "Debug" and "Release".
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><code>-V,--verbose</code></b>: Enable verbose output from tests.<br>
    <p>Test output is normally suppressed and only summary information is displayed.  This option will show all test output.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><code>-VV,--extra-verbose</code></b>: Enable more verbose output from tests.<br>
    <p>Test output is normally suppressed and only summary information is displayed.  This option will show even more test output.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><code>--debug</code></b>: Displaying more verbose internals of CTest.<br>
    <p>This feature will result in large number of output that is mostly useful for debugging dashboard problems.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><code>-Q,--quiet</code></b>: Make ctest quiet.<br>
    <p>This option will suppress all the output. The output log file will still be generated if the --output-log is specified. Options such as --verbose, --extra-verbose, and --debug are ignored if --quiet is specified.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><code>-O &lt;file&gt;, --output-log &lt;file&gt;</code></b>: Output to log file<br>
    <p>This option tells ctest to write all its output to a log file.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><code>-N,--show-only</code></b>: Disable actual execution of tests.<br>
    <p>This option tells ctest to list the tests that would be run but not actually run them.  Useful in conjunction with the -R and -E options.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><code>-R &lt;regex&gt;, --tests-regex &lt;regex&gt;</code></b>: Run tests matching regular expression.<br>
    <p>This option tells ctest to run only the tests whose names match the given regular expression.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><code>-E &lt;regex&gt;, --exclude-regex &lt;regex&gt;</code></b>: Exclude tests matching regular expression.<br>
    <p>This option tells ctest to NOT run the tests whose names match the given regular expression.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><code>-D &lt;dashboard&gt;, --dashboard &lt;dashboard&gt;</code></b>: Execute dashboard test<br>
    <p>This option tells ctest to perform act as a Dart client and perform a dashboard test. All tests are &lt;Mode&gt;&lt;Test&gt;, where Mode can be Experimental, Nightly, and Continuous, and Test can be Start, Update, Configure, Build, Test, Coverage, and Submit.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><code>-M &lt;model&gt;, --test-model &lt;model&gt;</code></b>: Sets the model for a dashboard<br>
    <p>This option tells ctest to act as a Dart client where the TestModel can be Experimental, Nightly, and Continuous. Combining -M and -T is similar to -D
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><code>-T &lt;action&gt;, --test-action &lt;action&gt;</code></b>: Sets the dashboard action to perform<br>
    <p>This option tells ctest to act as a Dart client and perform some action such as start, build, test etc. Combining -M and -T is similar to -D
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><code>--track &lt;track&gt;</code></b>: Specify the track to submit dashboard to<br>
    <p>Submit dashboard to specified track instead of default one. By default, the dashboard is submitted to Nightly, Experimental, or Continuous track, but by specifying this option, the track can be arbitrary.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><code>-S &lt;script&gt;, --script &lt;script&gt;</code></b>: Execute a dashboard for a configuration<br>
    <p>This option tells ctest to load in a configuration script which sets a number of parameters such as the binary and source directories. Then ctest will do what is required to create and run a dashboard. This option basically sets up a dashboard and then runs ctest -D with the appropriate options.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><code>-SP &lt;script&gt;, --script-new-process &lt;script&gt;</code></b>: Execute a dashboard for a configuration<br>
    <p>This option does the same operations as -S but it will do them in a seperate process. This is primarily useful in cases where the script may modify the environment and you do not want the modified enviroment to impact other -S scripts.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><code>-A &lt;file&gt;, --add-notes &lt;file&gt;</code></b>: Add a notes file with submission<br>
    <p>This option tells ctest to include a notes file when submitting dashboard. 
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><code>-I [Start,End,Stride,test#,test#|Test file], --tests-information</code></b>: Run a specific number of tests by number.<br>
    <p>This option causes ctest to run tests starting at number Start, ending at number End, and incrementing by Stride. Any additional numbers after Stride are considered individual test numbers.  Start, End,or stride can be empty.  Optionally a file can be given that contains the same syntax as the command line.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><code>-U, --union</code></b>: Take the Union of -I and -R<br>
    <p>When both -R and -I are specified by default the intersection of tests are run. By specifying -U the union of tests is run instead.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><code>--interactive-debug-mode [0|1]</code></b>: Set the interactive mode to 0 or 1.<br>
    <p>This option causes ctest to run tests in either an interactive mode or a non-interactive mode. On Windows this means that in non-interactive mode, all system debug pop up windows are blocked. In dashboard mode (Experimental, Nightly, Continuous), the default is non-interactive.  When just running tests not for a dashboard the default is to allow popups and interactive debugging.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><code>--build-and-test</code></b>: Configure, build and run a test.<br>
    <p>This option tells ctest to configure (i.e. run cmake on), build, and or execute a test. The configure and test steps are optional. The arguments to this command line are the source and binary directories. By default this will run CMake on the Source/Bin directories specified unless --build-nocmake is specified. Both --build-makeprogram and --build-generator MUST be provided to use --built-and-test. If --test-command is specified then that will be run after the build is complete. Other options that affect this mode are --build-target --build-nocmake, --build-run-dir, --build-two-config, --build-exe-dir, --build-project,--build-noclean, --build-options
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><code>--build-target</code></b>: Specify a specific target to build.<br>
    <p>This option goes with the --build-and-test option, if left out the all target is built.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><code>--build-nocmake</code></b>: Run the build without running cmake first.<br>
    <p>Skip the cmake step.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><code>--build-run-dir</code></b>: Specify directory to run programs from.<br>
    <p>Directory where programs will be after it has been compiled.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><code>--build-two-config</code></b>: Run CMake twice<br>
    
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><code>--build-exe-dir</code></b>: Specify the directory for the executable.<br>
    
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><code>--build-generator</code></b>: Specify the generator to use.<br>
    
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><code>--build-project</code></b>: Specify the name of the project to build.<br>
    
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><code>--build-makeprogram</code></b>: Specify the make program to use.<br>
    
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><code>--build-noclean</code></b>: Skip the make clean step.<br>
    
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><code>--build-options</code></b>: Add extra options to the build step.<br>
    <p>This option must be the last option with the exception of --test-command
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><code>--test-command</code></b>: The test to run with the --build-and-test option.<br>
    
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><code>--tomorrow-tag</code></b>: Nightly or experimental starts with next day tag.<br>
    <p>This is useful if the build will not finish in one day.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><code>--ctest-config</code></b>: The configuration file used to initialize CTest state when submitting dashboards.<br>
    <p>This option tells CTest to use different initialization file instead of DartConfiguration.tcl. This way multiple initialization files can be used for example to submit to multiple dashboards.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><code>--overwrite</code></b>: Overwrite CTest configuration option.<br>
    <p>By default ctest uses configuration options from configuration file. This option will overwrite the configuration option.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><code>--extra-submit &lt;file&gt;[;&lt;file&gt;]</code></b>: Submit extra files to the dashboard.<br>
    <p>This option will submit extra files to the dashboard.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><code>--force-new-ctest-process</code></b>: Run child CTest instances as new processes<br>
    <p>By default CTest will run child CTest instances within the same process. If this behavior is not desired, this argument will enforce new processes for child CTest processes.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><code>--submit-index</code></b>: Submit individual dashboard tests with specific index<br>
    <p>This option allows performing the same CTest action (such as test) multiple times and submit all stages to the same dashboard (Dart2 required). Each execution requires different index.
  </li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <b><code>--help-html [file]</code></b>: Print full help in HTML format.<br>
    <p>This option is used by CMake authors to help produce web pages.  If a file is specified, the help is written into it.
