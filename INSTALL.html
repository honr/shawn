<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<a name="Shawn">
<h3>1.1 Shawn</h3>

<p>

	Shawn is a discrete event simulator designed with the simulation
	of large wireless sensor networks in mind. It does not compete 
	with others well-known simulators by simulating individual ISO 
	layers and the protocols within these layers. Shawn emerged from 
	a more algorithmic approach of looking at sensor networks.<br>
	<br>
	More information can be found on the SwarmNET project page: 
	<a href="http://swarmnet.de/shawn/">http://swarmnet.de/shawn/</a>
	<br><br>
	
	Please see 3.5 <a href="#Shawn_licence">Shawn licence</a> for 
	copyright and licence information.
</p>

<a name="Buildsystem">
<h3>1.2 Buildsystem</h3>

<p>

	The Shawn buildsystem uses CMake (<a 
	href="http://cmake.org">http://cmake.org</a>) to provide an 
	easy way to build Shawn in a cross platform and compiler 
	independent fashion. Following these instructions, it is possible 
	to build Shawn under Windows (e.g. via Visual Studio), MacOSX and 
	several Linux distributions.

</p>
	
<a name="Shawn_directories">
<h3>1.3 Shawn directories</h3>

<p>
	After downloading Shawn, you should at least see the following 
	directories in the Shawn-root (among others):
</p>

<table border=0>
<tr>
	<td>bin</td>
	<td>The default directory where the shawn executable are built to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>buildfiles</td>
	<td>All build- and projectfles (makefile) are placed in this directory by CMake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>cmake</td>
	<td>The CMake binaries for windows, linux and MACOSX.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>lib</td>
	<td>The default directory where the shawn libraries are built to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>src</td>
	<td>The complete source tree of Shawn.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<br>    

<a name="Quick_start">
<h2>2. Quick start</h2>

<p>
	Following these instructions, the experienced user can quickly 
	create the buildfiles and compile Shawn. For a more detailed 
	description see the instructions below this chapter.
</p>	

<ol>
	<li>
		<p>
			Intall the <a href="http://expat.sourceforge.net">Expat</a>
			and <a href="http://www.cgal.org">CGAL</a> libraries if
			you plan to use them with Shawn (the latest version of 
			CGAL also needs the <a href="http://www.boost.org">Boost</a> library).
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>

			Start "cmake_linux.sh" (Linux), "cmake_macosx.sh" (MacOSX)
			or "cmake_win.bat" (Windows). Do a "configure" (click on 
			the button in Windows or pressing [c] under Linux/MacOSX)
			everytime you changed an option to update the
			buildsystem.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Use the CMake interface to configure all needed paths 
			(output directory, lib paths...). See 3.3
			<a href="#Buildsystem_Options">Buildsystem Options</a>
			for a description on each option.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Set "CONFIGURE_APPS" to "ON" if you wish to activate or 
			deactivate the modules individually.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			After everything is configured, click on "OK" in Windows
			or press [g] under Linux/MacOSX to generate the 
			buildfiles.<br>
     
			The buildfiles directory should now contain the necessary 
			files to build the Shawn executable (see 3.4
			<a href="#Building_Shawn">Building Shawn</a>).
		</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<a name="Compiling_Shawn">
<h2>3. Compiling Shawn</h2>
    
<a name="Requirements">
<h3>3.1 Requirements</h3>

<p>

	In order to build Shawn, you should have at least a properly 
	installed compiler, e.g. GCC or Visual Studio under Windows.
  
	Depending on the modules you are going to activate, you must have
	installed the Expat (<a href="http://expat.sourceforge.net">http://expat.sourceforge.net</a>)
	and/or CGAL (<a href="http://www.cgal.org">http://www.cgal.org</a>) libraries. 
	Refer to the build instructions for these libraries accordingly 
	(please note, the latest CGAL version also needs a working build 
	of the Boost library for C++, <a href="http://www.boost.org">http://www.boost.org</a>).

	You also need the CMake binaries for your platform. With this 
	Shawn package, CMake binaries for Linux, Windows and MACOS and 
	provided (you can find these in the cmake directory in the Shawn-
	root).
</p>

<a name="Creating_buildfiles_with_CMake">
<h3>3.2 Creating buildfiles with CMake</h3>

<p>
	Before building the Shawn executable, we are using CMake to 
	generate the buildfiles for us:
</p>

<a name="Linux_MacOSX">
<h3>3.2.1 Linux/MacOSX</h3>

<ol>
	<li>
		<p>
			Change the current directory to the Shawn-root and start 
			either "cmake_linux.sh" under Linux or "cmake_macosx.sh" 
			under MacOSX.<br>

     		<b>Note</b>: If you are not able to start CMake, you must 
     		set the executable flag for the start script and the 
     		cmake binaries, e.g.:<br><br>

			<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; chmod +x cmake.sh cmake/linux/bin/*</tt>
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
  			You should see the CMake text-GUI-interface with only one 
  			option line at the top of the screen. Press [c] to start 
  			the first configure-run. New options appear.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Now you have to edit the paths for the needed Libs 
			(expat, CGAL). Navigate with the arrow keys to the option 
			and press [enter] to edit it (don't forget to press 
			[enter] to finish editing an option).<br>

			Just leave the options blank if you do not wish to use a 
			library (e.g. leave all options including the string 
			"CGAL" blank, if you don't plan to use CGAL).<br>
     
			See 3.3 <a href="#Buildsystem_Options">Buildsystem 
			Options</a> for a description on each option.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Navigate to the Option "CONFIGURE_APPS" and set it to 
			"ON", if you wish to activate or deactivate the modules 
			individually.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			When you are finished editing the paths, press [c] again 
			to start another configure-run. If you have choosen to 
			set "CONFIGURE_APPS" to "ON", for each available Module 
			an option appears to activate or deactivate it.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Finally press [c] again to do a configure-run and then 
			press [g] to generate the buildfiles.<br>
     
			The buildfiles directory should now contain the necessary 
			files to build the Shawn executable (see 3.4
			<a href="#Building_Shawn">Building Shawn</a>).
		</p>
	</li>
</ol>


<a name="Windows">
<h3>3.2.2 Windows</h3>

<ol>
	<li>
		<p>
			Change the current directory to the Shawn-root and start 
			"cmake_win.bat".
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>

			You should see the CMake GUI-interface with several pre-
			configured options. First, you must ensure that the 
			"Where is the code" and "Where to build the binaries" 
			text fields at the top of the window contain the correct 
			paths. They must contain full paths, e.g.:<br>
			
			<table border=0>
			<tr>
				<td>Where is the code:</td>
				<td>c:\shawn\src</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Where to build the binaries:</td>
				<td>c:\shawn\buildfiles</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			
			Click on the button "Configure".
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			In the "Select Generator" window you must now select the 
			desired project type, for example "Visual Studio 8 2005" 
			to create a VS2005 project.<br>
			Click on "OK".
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Several new options appear in the CMake window. You have 
			to edit the paths for the needed libs (expat, CGAL). 
			Click on an option and then on the button labeled with 
			"..." to bring up the "Select path" dialog for each 
			option.<br>
     
			Just leave the options blank if you do not wish to use a 
			library (e.g. leave all options including the string 
			"CGAL" blank, if you don't plan to use CGAL).<br>
			
			See 3.3 <a href="#Buildsystem_Options">Buildsystem 
			Options</a> for a description on each option.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Navigate to the Option "CONFIGURE_APPS" and set it to 
			"ON", if you wish to activate or deactivate the modules 
			individually.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			When you have finished editing the paths, click on 
			"Configure" again. If you have choosen to set 
			"CONFIGURE_APPS" to "ON", for each available Module an 
			option appears to activate or deactivate it.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Finally click on "Configure" again and then on "OK" to generate the buildfiles.

			The buildfiles directory should now contain the necessary 
			files to build the Shawn executable (see 3.4
			<a href="#Building_Shawn">Building Shawn</a>), e.g. the
			Visual Studio 2005 solution file "SHAWN.sln".

<h3>3.4 Building Shawn</h3>

<p>

	If you have not done it yet, please see 3.2
	<a href="#Creating_buildfiles_with_CMake">Creating buildfiles
	with CMake</a> on how to create the needed buildfiles.<br><br>
  
	After CMake has created the buildfiles, you should either have a
	makefile or a Visual Studio solution (SHAWN.sln) file in the 
	"buildfiles" directory.
  
	To build the Shawn executeable, change the current directory to
	"buildfiles" and start "make" or open the Visual Studio solution 
	file "SHAWN.sln" and build the target "SHAWN".<br><br>
  
	After the compilation process has finished, the executable is 
	located in the "bin" directory by default.
